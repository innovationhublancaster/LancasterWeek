# What week is it?

A widget for Lancaster Uni that tells you what week it is. After seeing Southampton's high tech open data approach: https://github.com/ads04r/whatweekisit, we produced a super basic js hardcoded version.

Uni's run on week numbers, real people don't this helps you convert to weeks.
